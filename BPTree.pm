Tree::BPTree - Perl implementation of B+ trees

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Tree::BPTree;
  
  # These arguments are actually the defaults
  my $tree = new Tree::BPTree(
      -n        => 3,
      -unique   => 0,
      -keycmp   => sub { $_[0] cmp $_[1] },
      -valuecmp => sub { $_[0] <=> $_[1] },
  );

  # index the entries in this string:
  my $string = "THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO DO IT"; # TMTOWTDI
  my $i = 0;
  $tree->insert($_, $i++) foreach (split //, $string);

  # find the index of the first 'T'
  my $t = $tree->find('T');

  # find the indexes of every 'T'
  my @t = $tree->find('T');

  # We don't like the word 'WAY ', so let's remove it
  my $i = index $string, 'W';
  $tree->delete($_, $i++) foreach (split //, substr($string, $i, 4));

  # Reverse the sort order
  $tree->reverse;

  # Iterate through each key/value pair just like built-in each operator
  while (my ($key, $value) = $tree->each) {
      print "$key => $value\n";
  }

  # Reset the iterator when we quit from an "each-loop" early
  $tree->reset;

  # You might also be interested in using multiple each loops at once, which is
  # possible through the cursor syntax
  my $cursor = $tree->new_cursor;
  while (my ($key, $value) = $cursor->each) {
      my $nested = $tree->new_cursor;
      while (my ($nkey, $nvalue) = $nested->each) {

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B+ trees are balanced trees which provide an ordered map from keys to values.
They are useful for indexing large bodies of data. They are similar to 2-3-4
Trees and Red-Black Trees. This implementation supports B+ trees using an
arbitrary I<n> value.

=head2 STRUCTURE

Each node in a B+ tree contains I<n> pointers and I<n - 1> keys. The pointers
in the node are placed between the ordered keys so that there is one pointer on
either end and one pointer in between each value. Searching for a key involves
checking to see which keys in the node the key falls between and then following
the corresponding pointers down the tree.

The pointers in the branches of thre tree always point to nodes deeper in the
tree. The leaves use all pointers but the last to point to buckets containing
values. The last pointer in each leaf forms a singly-linked list called the
linked leaf list. Iterating through this list gives us an ordered traversal of
all keys and/or values in the tree.

Finally, all non-root branch nodes must contain at least I<n/2> pointers. If it
becomes necessary to add values to a node which already contains I<n> pointers,
then the node will be split in half first (possibly requiring the split of
parents). If deletion of a node leaves a branch with fewer than I<n/2> pointers,
the node will either be coalesced (joined to) a neigboring node or it will take
on a pointer from a neighbor node. Coalescing can also result in the further
rebalancing of the tree in parents using more coalesce or redistribute
operations.

Here's a diagram of a valid B+ tree when n = 3 that stores my last name,
"HANENKAMP":

            ---<K>----
           /          \
          /            \
         <H>         --<N>--
        /   \       /       \
       /     \     /        | 
     <A,E>> <H>> <K,M>>   <N,P>>
     / \     |   /  \    /  \
    /   \    |   |  |    |   \
  [1,6] [3] [0] [5][7] [2,4] [8]

Anyway, you don't need to know any of that to use this implementation. The
abstraction layer set on top makes it look something like a typical hash.
Insertion and deletion both require a specific key and value since multiple
values can be mapped to each key--unless the "-unique" flag has been set.

By default, the tree assumes that it is being used to map strings to indexes. I
chose to set this default because this is the most common use I will put it to.
That is, I have lists of strings that I want to index, so the keys will be the
strings to index and the values will be indexes into the list.

If you need to store something different, all you need to do is store a
reference to the objects (keys or values) and set the "-keycmp" and "-valuecmp"
options to appropriate values during initialization.

=head2 PERFORMANCE

At some point, I want to post the best, average, and worst-case operation speed
for this implementation of B+ trees, but for now we'll just have to live without
those stats.

=head2 IMPLEMENTATION

As a quick note on implementation, if you do want to know how specific
operations work, please browse the source. I have included extensive comments
within the definitions of the methods themselves explaining most of the
important steps. I did this for my own sanity because B+ trees can be quite
complicated.

=item $tree = Tree::BPTree->new(%args)

The constructor builds a new tree using the given arguments. All arguments are
optional and have defaults that should suit many applications. The arguments
include:

=over

=item -n

This sets the maximum number of pointers permitted in each node. Setting this
number very high will cause search operations to slow down as it will spend a
lot of time searching arrays incrementally--something like a binary search could
be used to speed these times a bit, but no such method is used at this time.
Setting this number very low will cause insert and delete operations to slow
down as they are required to split and coalesce more often. The default is the
minimum value of 3.

=item -unique

This determines whether keys are unique or not. If this is set, then an
exception will be raised whenever an insert is attempted for a key that already
exists in the tree.

=item -keycmp

This is a comparator function that takes two arguments and returns -1, 0, or 1
to indicate the result of the comparison. If the first argument is less than the
second, then -1 is returned. If the first argument is greater than the second,
then 1 is returned. If the arguments are equal, then 0 is returned. This
comparator should be appropriate for comparing keys. By default, the built-in
string comparator C<cmp> is used. See L<perlop> for details on C<cmp>.

=item -valuecmp

This is a comparator function that takes two arguments and returns -1, 0, or 1
to indicate the result of the comparison--just like the "-keycmp" argument. This
comparator should be appropriate for comparing values. By default, the built-in
numeric comparator C<E<lt>=E<gt>> is used. See L<perlop> for details on
C<E<lt>=E<gt>>.

=back

The tree created by this constructor is always initially empty.

=item $value = $tree->find($key)

=item @values = $tree->find($key)

This method attempts to find the value or values in the bucket matching C<$key>.
If no such C<$key> has been stored in the tree, then C<undef> is returned. If
the C<$key> is found, then either the first value stored in the bucket is
returned (in scalar context) or all values stored are returned (in list
context). Using scalar context is useful when the tree stores unique keys where
there will never be more than one value per key.

	$leaf->insert($leaf->find($cmp, $key), $key, [ $value ]);
}

=item $tree->delete($key, $value)

This method removes the key/value pair given from the tree. If the pair cannot
be found, then the tree is not changed. If C<$value> is stored multiple times at
C<$key>, then all values matching C<$value> will be removed.
=cut

sub delete {
	my ($self, $key, $value) = @_;
	my $cmp = $$self{-keycmp};
	my $valcmp = $$self{-valuecmp};

	# In the case of delete, we have two steps:
	#   1. Find the leaf containing the key.
	#        a. If no matching key is found in the leaf where it should be, quit.
	#        b. If the bucket for the key found contains multiple values, remove
	#           one and quit.
	#        c. Otherwise, continue to step 2.
	#   2. Starting at the top, tell the tree to delete the node.
	#        a. The tree will then prune off any leaves that become empty.
	#        b. The tree will prune of branches that aren't needed. This may
	#           result in branches with less than n/2 nodes, so we will need to
	#           rebalance the tree.
	#        c. The tree will perform rebalancing on it's way back up from the
	#           leaf. It will attempt to coalesce where needed and possible and
	#           redistribute if needed and coalesce won't work.
	
	# First, find the leaf containing the key
	my $leaf = $self->_find_leaf($key);
	my $i = $leaf->find($cmp, $key);
	if (defined $leaf->[($i) * 2 + 1] && &$cmp($leaf->[($i) * 2 + 1], $key) == 0) {
		if (scalar(@{ $leaf->[($i) * 2] }) > 1) {

			# no match for value, let's quit
			return;
		}
	} else {
		# no match for key, let's quit
		return;
	}

	# Then, since we're still here, we know there is a key/value match that
	# we intend to remove. Since this removal will empty a bucket, we need to
	# bring out the big guns. Tell the tree to take care of it and it will take
	# care of coalescing and redistributing nodes.
	my $values = $$self{-root}->delete($$self{-n}, $cmp, $key);

	# if the tree contains only a single value and is a branch, then the tree is
	# one level shallower than before the delete
	$$self{-root} = $$self{-root}->[0]
			if not $$self{-root}->isa('Tree::BPTree::Leaf') and $values == 1;
}

=item $tree->reverse

Reverse the sort order. This is done by reversing every key in the tree,
adjusting the linked leaf list, and replacing the "-keycmp" method with a new
one that simply negates the old one. If this method is called again, the same
node reversal will happen, but the original "-keycmp" will be reinstated rather
than doing a double negation.

=cut

sub reverse {
	my ($self) = @_;
	$$self{-root}->reverse;
	if (defined $$self{-reverse_keycmp}) {
		$$self{-keycmp} = delete $$self{-reverse_keycmp};
	} else {
		$$self{-reverse_keycmp} = $$self{-keycmp};
		my $cmp = $$self{-keycmp};
		$$self{-keycmp} = sub { -( &$cmp(@_) ) };
	}
}

=item $cursor = $tree->new_cursor

This method allows you to have multiple, simultaneous iterators through the
same index. If you pass the C<$cursor> value returned from C<new_cursor> to
C<each>, it will be used instead of the default internal cursor. That is,

  my $c1 = $tree->new_cursor;
  my $c2 = $tree->new_cursor;
  while (my ($key, $value) = $tree->each($c1)) {
      # let's go through $c1 twice as fast
      my ($nextkey, $nextvalue) = $tree->each($c1);
      my ($otherkey, $othervalue) = $tree->each($c2);
  }

  # and we can reset $c2 after we're done too
  $tree->reset($c2);

Cursors also have their own methods, so this same snippet could have been
written like this instead:

  my $c1 = $tree->new_cursor;
  my $c2 = $tree->new_cursor;
  while (my ($key, $value) = $c1->each) {
      # let's go through $c1 twice as fast
      my ($nextkey, $nextvalue) = $c1->each;
      my ($otherkey, $othervalue) = $c2->each;
  }

  # and we can reset $c2 after we're done too
  $c2->reset;

=cut

package Tree::BPTree::Cursor;

# These keep the real work in Tree::BPTree
sub each {
	my ($self) = @_;
	$$self{-tree}->each($self);
}

sub reset {
	my ($self) = @_;
	$$self{-tree}->reset($self);

sub new_cursor {
	my ($self) = @_;
	return bless { -tree => $self }, 'Tree::BPTree::Cursor';
}

=item ($key, $value) = $tree->each [ ($cursor) ]

This method provides a similar facility as that of the C<each> operator. Each
call will iterate through each key/value pair in sort order. After the last
key/value pair has been returned, C<undef> will be returned once before starting
again. This is useful for using within C<while> loops:

  while (my ($key, $value) = $tree->each) {
      # do stuff
  }

=cut

sub each {
	my ($self, $cursor) = @_;
	$cursor = $$self{-cursor} unless defined $cursor;

	# This method operates on a cursor in three states:
	#   1. Fresh. $$cursor{-index} is undefined to show that we are in a fresh
	#      state and should return the very first index.
	#   2. Iterating. $$cursor{-index} and $$cursor{-node} are defined to show
	#      that we are somewhere in the middle of the list.
	#   3. Dead. $$cursor{-node} is undefined to show that we have reached the
	#      last node. At this point () should be returned and then
	#      $$cursor{-index} deleted to return us to Fresh state.
	#
	# It is possible to move directly from Fresh to Dead in one call by checking
	# the size of $$cursor{-node}. If $$cursor{-node}->nvalues == 1, then the
	# very first node is empty, so we immediately return that we are Dead and
	# return to a Fresh state.

	# If the cursor is empty, then they haven't ran each yet (or the last run
	# has concluded). Set a new iteration run up.
	unless (defined $$cursor{-index}) {
		$$cursor{-node}  = $$self{-root}->first_leaf;
		$$cursor{-index} = 0;
	}

	if (defined $$cursor{-node} and (@{$$cursor{-node}} + 1) / 2 > 1) {
		# The last run didn't detect the end of the list, so give them the next
		# value
		my @next = (
			$$cursor{-node}->[($$cursor{-index}) * 2 + 1],
			$$cursor{-node}->[($$cursor{-index}) * 2],
		);

		# Increment the pointer
		if ($$cursor{-index} + 1 == (@{$$cursor{-node}} + 1) / 2 - 1) {
			# We've reached the end of a node, move to the next
			my $next_node = $$cursor{-node}->[($$cursor{-index} + 1) * 2];

			# Check for orphaned nodes and remove them
			while (defined $next_node and (@$next_node + 1) / 2 == 1) {
				$next_node = $next_node->[0];
			}
			$$cursor{-node}->[($$cursor{-index} + 1) * 2] = $next_node;

			# Move to the next node
			$$cursor{-node}  = $next_node;
			$$cursor{-index} = 0;
		} else {
			# We've still got more key/value pairs to read in this node
			++$$cursor{-index};
		}

		return @next;
	} else {
		# The last run reached the end of the list, so delete the -index element
		# so we can start anew and return undef once, just like the each
		# operator.
		delete $$cursor{-index};
		return ();
	}
}

=item $tree->reset [ ($cursor) ]

Reset the given cursor to a fresh state--that is, ready to return the first
value on the next call to C<each>. If no C<$cursor> is given, then the default
internal cursor is reset.

=cut

sub reset {
	my ($self, $cursor) = @_;
	$cursor = $$self{-cursor} unless defined $cursor;
	delete $$cursor{-index};
}

=item $tree->iterate(\&iter)

For each key/value pair in the database, the function C<&iter> will be called
with the key as the first argument and value as the second. Iteration will occur
in sort order.

=cut

sub iterate {
	my ($self, $iter) = @_;

	while (my ($k, $v) = $self->each) {
		&$iter($k, $v);
	}
}

=item @results = $tree->map(\&mapper)

Nearly identical to C<iterate>, this method captures the return values of each
call and then returns all the results as a list. The C<&mapper> function takes
the same arguments as in C<iterate>.

=cut

sub map {
	my ($self, $mapper) = @_;

	my @result;
	while (my ($k, $v) = $self->each) {

=item @keys = $tree->grep_keys(\&pred)

=item @values = $tree->grep_values(\&pred)

=item @flattened_values = $tree->grep_flattened_values(\&pred)

Iterates through all key/value pairs in sort order. For each key/value pair, the
function C<&pred> will be called by passing the key as the first argument and
the value as the second. If C<&pred> returns a true value, then the matched
value will be added to the returned list.

C<grep> returns a list of pairs such that each element is a two-element array
reference where the first element is they key and the second is the value. 

C<grep_keys> returns a list of keys.

C<grep_values> returns a list of values, such that each value is an array
reference containing all the values in each bucket.

C<grep_flattened_values> returns a list of values where each bucket has been
flattened into a single list.

=cut

sub grep {
	my ($self, $pred) = @_;

=item @pairs = $tree->pairs

=item @keys = $tree->keys

=item @values = $tree->values

=item @flattened_values = $tree->flattened_values

Returns all elements of the given type.

C<pairs> returns all key/value pairs stored in the tree. Each pair is returned
as an array reference contain two elements. The first element is the key. The
second element is a bucket, which is an array-reference of stored values.

C<keys> returns all keys stored in the tree.

C<values> returns all buckets of values stored in the tree. Each bucket is an
array-reference of stored values.

C<flattened_values> returns all values stored in the tree by flattening the
buckets of stored values.

=cut

	my ($self) = @_;

	my @pairs;

		push @values, @$v;
	}

	return @values;
}

=item $tree->clear

This method empties the tree of all values. This basically creates a new tree
and allows the old tree to be garbage collected at the interpreter's leisure.

=head1 CREDITS

The basis for B+ trees implemented here can be found in I<Database System
Concepts>, 4th ed. by Silbershatz et al. published by McGraw-Hill. I have
somewhat modified the structure specified there to make the code easier to read
and to adapt the code to Perl.

In addition, while preparing to write this module I also consulted an old book
of mine, I<C++ Algorithms> by Robert Sedgewick (Addison Wesley), for more
general information on trees. I also used some ideas on how and when to perform
split, coalesce, and redistribute as the Silbershatz pseudo-code is a little
obfuscated--or at least, the different operations are presented monolithically
so that it's difficult to digest. The sections in Sedgewick on 2-3-4 and
Red-Black trees were especially helpful.

=head1 BUGS

This module is pretty slow. Better performance is possible, especially for small
bodies of data, if you use a hash to do most of these operations. See
F<benchmark.pl> for a sample of the performance issues. There you can also find
code for performing essentially the same thing using different data structures.

On my machine, a small benchmark showed the following:

  Insert into B+ Trees (this implementation) is:
    62   times slower than hash insert and
     4   times slower than list insert.

  Ordered iteration of B+ Trees is:
     1.3 times slower than ordering a hash and then iterating the pairs and
    12   times slower than iterating through an ordered list.

  Finding a key in B+ Trees is:
    73   times slower than hash fetch but
     1.2 times faster than searching an ordered list (with grep, which probably
         isn't the fastest solution).

I'm still putting together more benchmarks and looking into places where
improvement is possible. Iteration of this structure should scale better than
taking a hash and ordering the keys to iterate through.

I have made some recent headway by removing some simple functions and replacing
them with raw computation. If I did this the way I'd really like to, I need to
find or build a L<Filter::Simple> module to perform something similar to a C
C<#define> or C++ C<inline> function. However, instead I just did a search and
replace with Vim.

I should probably port this to XS to make it really compete with built-in
hashes.
