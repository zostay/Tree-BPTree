	- Added the reverse() method to perform an action similar to the Perl
	  reverse operator.
	- Added the new_cursor() method and altered the way each() works to allow

	- Added a missing pairs() method.
	- Altered keys(), values(), and flattened_values() to use the new each()
	  method with a cursor.
	- Added t/cursors.t to test simultaneous cursors.
	- Added t/reverse.t to test reverse().
	- Added t/reverse_find.t to test find() after a reverse() has taken
