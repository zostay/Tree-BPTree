Tree-BPTree version 1.06
========================

This is a Perl implementation of B+ trees. I have based this implementation on a
couple of sources. See the documentation of Tree::BPTree for those details. A B+
tree is essentially an order map from keys to values. Keys are multivalued so
that there may be more than one value per key. This implementation will enforce
uniqueness of keys, if requested.

For more details see the documentation for Tree::BPTree. For examples using the
code, see the documentation, try.pl, or the test files.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module currently requires Perl 5.8.0 and that's it. It's probably
compatible with previous versions of Perl, but I haven't tested it.
